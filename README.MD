Usage of SiteSpeed:
     -apiKey string
           (required)
           API key for using Google PageSpeedOnline. It can be received at 
           https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/get-started#key.
     -duration string
           Duration to sleep between requests for each site. Default value is 1.5s
           Minimum time between requests to pagespeedonline api is 1s, but even default 1.5s is too little 
           sometimes. A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional 
           fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "1.5h" or "2h45m".
           Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h". (default "1.5s")
     -noLogs
           If set, there is no log output to STDOUT.
     -output string
           Path to output in YAML format. Default value is "".
           If it is empty (default value), then output to STDOUT.
     -sites string
           (required) 
           Path to file with sites. On each row there must be only one site, row should end with comma (,) and
           can be surrounded with double quotes (").
